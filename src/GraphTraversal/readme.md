# Graph Traversal

## 1. Depth-first search
A depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing a finite graph. DFS visits the child vertices before visiting the sibling vertices; that is, it traverses the depth of any particular path before exploring its breadth. A stack (often the program's call stack via recursion) is generally used when implementing the algorithm.

## 2. Breadth-first search
A breadth-first search (BFS) is another technique for traversing a finite graph. BFS visits the neighbor vertices before visiting the child vertices, and a queue is used in the search process. This algorithm is often used to find the shortest path from one vertex to another.
